# input desintaiton prompt
Enter Destination; 
(1=ARG;2=THIS;3=THAT)

# input line number prompt
Enter Line Number (Enter Preeceeding; 
zero for single digits)

# level 1
Move all the numbers in the inbox to the outbox. Click on the inbox and outbox blocks to add them to your program.
Click the play button to run your program. If you fail, try again by clicking the restart button. 

# Level 2
Now output all 7 numbers in the inbox to the outbox. Instead of using 14 blocks, try using the Jump block. 
The jump block will jump to the line number that you enter.

# Level 3
In computers, there are registers (RAM) to temporarily store information so that a program can manipulate 
the values. Use the CopyTo and CopyFrom blocks to Output the number in the inbox two times.

# Level 4
Heres an example of how regsiters can be used in computers. Inbox the 1 and 0 into THIS and THAT.
For all the remaining values, output a zero if they are negative and output 1 if they are positive.

# Level 5
Now take the first two numbers in the inbox, reverse them, and output them. 
Repeat this until the inbox is empty. 

# Level 6
Computers have an ALU (Arithmatic logic unit) that allows them to do basic math.
For every two things in the inbox, add them together and then outbox the result.

# Level 7
Condtional statements are elementary to computer science and allow computers make descisions. 
Use the Jump if zero block to output all numbers that aren't zero. Hint: the Jump if zero block checks the value in ARG

# Level 8
For each two values in the inbox, us the sub block to subtract the first from the second and output the result 
before subtracting the second from the first and outputting the result. Repeat for the entire inbox. 

# Level 9
These blocks are limiting, but computer scientists have to deal with limitations in expression. Compare
every two values in the inbox with each other, and output the greatest of the two. If they are the same 
output either one. 

# level 10
Computer scientists often need to clean/modify inputs. Output all the values from the inbox, if 
a value is negative, make it positive, and then output it. 

# Level 11
The ALU we talked about earlier can add and subtract, but cannot multiply. For each two values in the 
inbox, multiply them, and output the product. (Yes this is possible in 15 lines.)

Countdown time! for each value in the inbox, countdown to zero (or up to if negative), outboxing each
number along the way. (Yes, this is possible in 14 lines.)
