# SDP for 1181.02
This repository is for my group's software design project for 1181.02
We are creating a game similar to human resource machine involving block programing.
Matlab is an awful language and is even worse to design a game in. TBH jack from nand2tetris is a waaay better lanugage. 
Anyways the sprites can be found here:

its crazy that mathworks can make people pay for a crappy IDE and language

##matlab is an esoteric language
reading rust as a complete newbie was easier than trying to read objective matlab code. I hope mathworks feels bad about their descisions.
